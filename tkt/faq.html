            <h2 id="what-for">What is this for?</h2>
            <p>It's for any time you need to type with one hand! If you're eating, holding a document, or anything in between, 
                TenKeyType allows you to type one-handed while losing minimal speed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 id="how-hard">How hard is it to use?</h2>
            <p>Because it's based on qwerty, anybody can learn to use TenKeyType in just a few minutes?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 id="how-use">How do I use it?</h2>
            <p>The software maps certain keys and key combinations on your number pad to things that you would normally type with two hands.
                The first time you use it, there will be a simple tutorial for exactly which buttons to press for what.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 id="no-tenkey">I don't have a number pad, can I still use it?</h2>
            <p>No. A number pad is required to use the software. You could purchase an external number pad if your keyboard doesn't include one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 id="software-support">What software does it support?</h2>
            <p>Anywhere that you would normally type, you can use TenKeyType. Social media, office applications, messaging apps,
                in-game chat...if you can type in it, then you can use TenKeyType.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 id="programming">Can I use this for programming?</h2>
            <p>TenKeyType is designed for typing natural English, and probably won't be very comfortable to use for programming. 
                However, you're welcome to give it a try in <a href="#manual-mode">manual mode.</a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 id="other-languages">Are languages besides English supported?</h2>
            <p>Languages besides English are not officially supported. However, you can switch to manual mode to enable per-character input,
                allowing you to type in whatever language you want.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 id="manual-mode">What is manual mode?</h2>
            <p>TenKeyType normally requires only one keystroke per letter, and it figures out what you're trying to type from context. 
                In manual mode, pressing one key multiple times will cycle through all the letters it is assigned to. It's kind of like 
                texting on an old cell phone.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 id="cant-download">Why can't I download the software?</h2>
            <p>If you've stumbled accross this page, you may be wondering why all the download buttons just give you a txt file. 
                I'm creating this website as part of a school project, and the software itself doesn't actually exist yet. Stay tuned!
