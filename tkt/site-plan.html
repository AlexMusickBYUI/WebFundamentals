      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>TenKeyType will be a software program that will allow a user to type quickly and comfortable using only the number pad, allowing for efficient one-handed typing. This webpage will serve as a landing page providing information and eventually download links for the software.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anybody who spends significant amounts of time typing in natural language while multitasking. In particular, there is a special appeal to those working in data entry, accounting, or other fields that require writing frequent reports based on physical documents; so mostly young to middle-aged adults working in non-technical fields.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <h>What is this for?</h>
      <p>It's for any time you need to type with one hand! If you're eating, holding a document, or anything in between,
         TenKeyType allows you to type one-handed without losing any speed.</p>

      <h>How hard is it to use?</h>
      <p>Because it's based on qwerty, anybody can learn to use TenKeyType in just a few minutes.</p>

      <h>How do I use it?</h>
      <p>The software maps certain keys and key combinations on your number pad to things that you would
        normally type with two hands. The software walks you through using it during first-time setup, and you can see
        a general overview here.
      </p>

      <h>Who can use it?</h>
      <p>TenKeyType is available for anybody to use.</p>

      <h>What software does it support?</h>
      <p>Anywhere that you would normally type, you can use TenKeyType.
        Social media, office applications, messagins applications, in-game chat...if you can type in it, then you can use TenKeyType.
      </p>

      <h>Are languages besides English supported?</h>
      <p>Languages besides English are not officially supported. However, you can switch to manual mode
        to enable per-character input, allowing you to type in whatever language you want.
      </p>

      <h>What is manual mode?</h>
      <p>TenkeyType normally requires only one keystroke per letter, and it figures out what you're trying to type from context.
        In manual mode, pressing one key multiple times will cycle through all the letters it is assigned to.
        It's kind of like texting on an old cell phone.
      </p>

      <h>Why can't I download the software?</h>
      <p>If you've stumbled accross this page, you may be wondering why the download buttons all just give you a txt file.
        I'm creating this page as part of a school assignment, and the software itself doesn't exist yet.
