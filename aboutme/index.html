    <p2>Hello! As you can probably tell from what's above, my name is Alex Musick. I'm a CIT major with an emphasis in cybersecurity, <br>
        and I hope to pursue cybersecurity auditing or research as a career. I just finished serving my mission in the Philippines <br>
        and Texas back in August, and I'm currently on my second semester here at BYUI.
    </p2>
    <br> <br>
    <p3>My hobbies have drifted around a lot, and I've picked up a lot of random things over time, like magic tricks, lock picking, <br>
        music production, and filmmaking. The two things that I've always been consistently interested in are the piano and, of course, <br>
        computers. I'm super excited to be in this class because web design is unique combination of technical and visual design, and while <br>
        I've done some things with both in the past, I've never put them together before!
